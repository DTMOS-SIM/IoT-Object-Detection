# IoT-Object-Detection
OpenCV lightweight object detection program


### Theorical Design
This implementation is based off the frame differencing algorithm through background subtraction technqiues to obtain a refined object detection mechanism. It deploys openCV's library as it consist of built-in classes and abstract methods to simplfied the entire development process.
